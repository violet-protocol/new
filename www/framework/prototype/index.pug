							h1.section__heading What Identity is
							p Violet is a new identity protocol built on Ethereum to connect on-chain with verified off-chain identities and serve as an orchestration platform for authentication and authorization against other protocols and applications.
							p While we think the protocol can serve as a primitive for many use cases, we are going to launch with a direct productization that will enable institutional participation across various DeFi protocols – essentially on-chain compliance as a service. 
							p We are building Violet upon the principles of privacy, transparency and decentralization; it is our goal to enable composability of identities across the crypto stack (and beyond) and prevent fragmentation of identity data.
